# Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Finding Lane Lines on the Road

This is the first project in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. In it, I use computer vision methods like Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform to detect lane lines on the road. See my write-up [here](http://jaredj.xyz/projects/sdcnanodegree/)

## Requirements

Git LFS  
Jupyter  
MoviePy  
OpenCV3  

## Running

Just run  
`jupyter notebook P1.ipynb`  
and then follow along with the code.
